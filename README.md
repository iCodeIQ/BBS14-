Hey guys thanks so much for taking time to read this file! 

So your job today is to make a house on Minecraft Pi using some of the code from the lecture. 
Our team has provided skeleton code for the program you'll work on today. 

Before you begin programming, recall the information that was covered in the lecture. If you're having difficulty understanding how to apply some of the concepts, ask your instructor for help. 

The steps below provide a general idea of the steps you should focus on: 

1. Begin by importing the libraires that you'll need. 
2. Define and intialize your player's position.
3. Define and intialize the demensions of the structure.
4. Use mc.setBlocks to make the ceiling and walls.
5. Use mc.setBlocks to make the floors.
6. Add a door and windows.


Friendly note: If you're having a hard time it's okay, remember-- "Progression over perfection"

Good Luck!! :)
